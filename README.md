# WOODCOM
Woody Biomas Companion Markets Model

The objective of this work is to analyze the dynamics of biomass resource distribution across multiple industries under different 
conditions. To this end, a simulation model is developed that projects the volume and price dynamics between the biomass resource 
base (supply) and different demand industries including intermediate processing (i.e., mobilization) and end-use markets (traditional, 
companion, and biofuels). This allows to model resource mobilization and price developments over time given varying levels of companion 
and biofuel market growth. The model is limited to the U.S. southeast, the nation’s primary supply shed for purpose grown softwood, 
covering the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, Eastern Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. The region boasts the vast majority of installed wood pelleting capacity and annual 
production.
